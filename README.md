Nova Threading====* Action Queuing system designed for the Nova project.	* Branched into this repository after growing enough to be a standalone project.* Allows queuing through a manager on several queues.* A queue can be created, destroyed or blocked.* A blocked queue will not execute anything.* Queues are built on top of .NET's dataflow library.* Actions that belong to non-existant queues don't get executed.* Action implementation is decoupled from the queuing system. A WPF specific dll has already been made, based on the TPL.
